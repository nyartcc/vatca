For immediate release.

The board of VATCA - the Virtual Air Traffic Controllers Association are proud to announce the formation of the first union for VATSIM members VATCA.
For a long time, VATSIM and VATUSA members have grown tired of VATUSA and VATSIM leadership not representing the toughts and ideas of the networks members, but instead, only serve their own agenda. To that, VATCA say no! 

We are here to represent every VATUSA member, and make their voices heard!

As a result of the current VATUSA/VATSIM leadership, VATCA is voicing our opposition to the direction of VATUSA and announces that on **April 15th**, from **00:00z**, VATCA members as one will be walking out on strike.

We urge VATSIM to listen to our members, and to move swiftly to take action.
